## What is Urdu?
 
Urdu is a member of the Indo-Aryan branch of the Indo-European language family. It is closely related to Hindi, Punjabi, Sindhi, Gujarati, and other languages spoken in the Indian subcontinent. Urdu is written in a modified form of the Persian alphabet, which is derived from the Arabic script. Urdu is also influenced by Persian, Arabic, Turkish, Sanskrit, and other languages.
 
Urdu is known for its rich and diverse literature, which includes poetry, prose, drama, fiction, non-fiction, and religious texts. Some of the most famous Urdu writers are Mirza Ghalib, Allama Iqbal, Faiz Ahmed Faiz, Saadat Hasan Manto, Ismat Chughtai, and Ahmed Faraz.
 
## The Origins of Urdu
 
The history of Urdu can be traced back to the 8th century CE, when the Arab invaders brought Islam and Arabic language to the Indian subcontinent. The interaction between the local languages and Arabic led to the emergence of various dialects that were collectively called Hindavi or Dehlavi. These dialects were spoken in different regions of northern India, especially around Delhi.
 
In the 13th century CE, the Mongol invasions brought Persian and Turkish speakers to India. They established the Delhi Sultanate and later the Mughal Empire. The court language of these dynasties was Persian, which had a profound impact on Hindavi. The fusion of Hindavi with Persian and Turkish gave rise to a new language that was called Rekhta or Zaban-e-Urdu-e-Mualla (the language of the exalted city).
 
Rekhta or Urdu was initially used as a lingua franca among the soldiers and traders of different backgrounds. It gradually spread to other domains of society and culture. It became a medium of poetry and literature under the patronage of the Mughal emperors and nobles. It also became a symbol of identity and resistance for the Muslims of India.
 
## The Development of Urdu
 
The history of Urdu can be divided into four periods: Old Urdu (8th-13th centuries CE), Classical Urdu (14th-18th centuries CE), Modern Urdu (19th-20th centuries CE), and Contemporary Urdu (21st century CE).
