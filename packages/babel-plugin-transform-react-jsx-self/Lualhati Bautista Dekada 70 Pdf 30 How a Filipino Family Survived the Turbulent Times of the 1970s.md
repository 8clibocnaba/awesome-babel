The novel tells the story of the Bartolome family, a middle-class Filipino family who lived through the turbulent decade of the 1970s. The protagonist is Amanda Bartolome, the mother of five sons and the wife of Julian, a company executive. Amanda struggles to cope with the changes in her family and in her society as she witnesses the rise of activism, rebellion, and violence among her sons and her fellow Filipinos. She also questions her role as a woman and a mother in a patriarchal culture that stifles her growth and freedom.
 
The novel depicts the historical events that shaped the Philippines during the Marcos regime, such as the bombing of Plaza Miranda, the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus, the proclamation of martial law, the random arrests and torture of political prisoners, the assassination of Ninoy Aquino, and the People Power Revolution. The novel also explores the themes of nationalism, human rights, social justice, and feminism.
