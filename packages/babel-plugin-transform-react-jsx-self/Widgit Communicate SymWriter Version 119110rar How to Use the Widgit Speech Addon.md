### Typing and Symbolising Text
 
As you type text in SymWriter, symbols will appear above the words in the symbol bar. You can use these symbols to check if you have typed the correct word or if you need to change it. You can also click on a symbol in the symbol bar to insert it in your document.
 
SymWriter uses a feature called "smart symbolising" to analyse your text and choose the most appropriate symbols for it. For example, if you type "bat", SymWriter will show different symbols depending on whether you mean an animal or a tool:

If SymWriter does not show the symbol you want, you can change it by right-clicking on it and choosing another option from the menu that appears:
