Kenoly began his musical education in church, singing in a children's choir. He was serious about music from an early age and decided to become a musician. While serving in the Air Force Kenoly joined a band called the Mellow Fellows and toured military bases performing Top 40 hits. Soon after leaving the military Kenoly became a popular nightclub entertainer in Los Angeles and had some success as an R&B performer, recording for major record labels such as MCA and A&M.
 
By the mid-1970s the demands of Kenoly's career had begun to affect his family and personal life. Kenoly attributes the recommitment of his life to Jesus Christ in 1975 to the personal crisis he suffered in the early 1970s. Kenoly began trying to break into the gospel music scene in the late 1970s but had very little success until he produced his own album You Ought to Listen to Thisin 1983. He began his full-time ministry in 1985 when he became Minister of Music at the Jubilee Christian Center in San Jose, California.
