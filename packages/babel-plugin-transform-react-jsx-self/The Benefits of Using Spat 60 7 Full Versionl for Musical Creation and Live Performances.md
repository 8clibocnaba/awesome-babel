To illustrate the potential of immersive audio, let's look at some examples of how it can be used in different contexts and genres.
 
## Live Concerts
 
One of the most obvious applications of immersive audio is to recreate the experience of attending a live concert. With immersive audio, listeners can feel like they are in the middle of the crowd, surrounded by the sound of the band and the audience. They can also hear details that are usually lost in stereo recordings, such as the reflections of the venue, the movement of the performers on stage, and the spatial cues that help locate each instrument. For example, Sony 360 Reality Audio has partnered with Live Nation to offer immersive live streams and recordings of concerts from artists such as Coldplay, Miley Cyrus, and Imagine Dragons[^2^].
 
## Music Production
 
Immersive audio also opens up new creative possibilities for music production. Artists and producers can use immersive audio to enhance their musical expression and storytelling, by placing sounds in different locations and heights, creating dynamic movements and transitions, and adding depth and realism to their mixes. For example, Alicia Keys' latest album "Alicia" was mixed in Sony 360 Reality Audio by producer Ann Mincieli, who used immersive audio to create a more intimate and emotional connection with the listeners[^2^]. Other examples of albums mixed in immersive audio include "Random Access Memories" by Daft Punk, "The Dark Side of the Moon" by Pink Floyd, and "Abbey Road" by The Beatles.
 
## Sound Design
 
Immersive audio can also enhance the sound design for film, TV, gaming, and other media. By using immersive audio, sound designers can create more realistic and immersive soundscapes that match the visual content and engage the audience. They can also use immersive audio to convey information, emotion, and mood, by manipulating the direction, distance, and intensity of sounds. For example, Sound On Sound magazine explains how sound designer Ren Klyce used immersive audio to create a stunning soundscape for the Netflix film "Mank", which recreates the Hollywood of the 1930s[^1^]. Other examples of films that use immersive audio include "Gravity", "Dunkirk", and "Avatar".
