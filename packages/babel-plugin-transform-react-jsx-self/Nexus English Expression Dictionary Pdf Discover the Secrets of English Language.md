Here are some more paragraphs for the article:
 
One of the advantages of the Nexus English Expression Dictionary is that it provides clear and concise definitions and explanations for each expression. Unlike some other dictionaries that use complex or technical terms to describe the meaning of an expression, this book uses simple and accessible language that can be easily understood by learners of different levels and backgrounds. The book also avoids using obscure or outdated expressions that are rarely used in modern English.
 
Another advantage of the book is that it offers a variety of examples for each expression. The examples are taken from real sources, such as newspapers, magazines, books, movies, TV shows, songs, etc. The examples show how the expressions are used in different contexts and situations, and how they can convey different tones and emotions. The examples also help learners see how the expressions are related to other words and structures in a sentence.
 
A third advantage of the book is that it includes synonyms and antonyms for many expressions. This feature can help learners enrich their vocabulary and avoid repetition. It can also help learners understand the subtle differences and similarities between expressions that have similar or opposite meanings. For example, the book explains that "to be on cloud nine" and "to be over the moon" are synonyms that mean "to be very happy", but "to be on cloud nine" is more informal and American, while "to be over the moon" is more formal and British.
