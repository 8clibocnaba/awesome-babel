Soap Skin and Bubble is a free extension for SketchUp that allows you to create complex and organic shapes with ease. It works by creating a smooth surface from a closed loop of edges or curves, and then applying pressure to inflate or deflate it.

Once you have your loop ready, select it and click on the Generate Soap Skin button. A dialog box will appear where you can specify the number of divisions for your surface. The higher the number, the smoother the surface will be, but also the more polygons it will have. Click OK to generate the surface.
 
To edit the pressure of your surface, select it and click on the Edit Pressure button. A slider will appear where you can adjust the pressure value. Positive values will inflate your surface, while negative values will deflate it. You can also type in a specific value in the VCB (value control box) at the bottom right corner of SketchUp. Press Enter to apply the pressure.
 
To delete your surface, select it and click on the Delete Soap Skin button. This will remove the surface and leave only the original loop of edges or curves.
 
## Tips and Examples
 
Here are some tips and examples to help you get the most out of Soap Skin and Bubble:

- You can use different shapes of loops to create different types of surfaces. For example, you can use circles, squares, triangles, stars, etc.
- You can use multiple loops to create more complex shapes. For example, you can use a 3D frame of loops to create a tent-like structure.
- You can use different values of pressure to create different effects. For example, you can use high positive values to create balloons or bubbles, low positive values to create pillows or cushions, low negative values to create dents or craters, high negative values to create spikes or horns.
