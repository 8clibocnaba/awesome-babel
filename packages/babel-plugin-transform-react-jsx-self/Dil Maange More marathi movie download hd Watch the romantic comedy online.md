Dil Maange More is a movie that showcases the talent and charm of Shahid Kapoor, who plays the role of Nikhil with sincerity and conviction. He portrays the emotions of love, confusion, frustration and happiness with ease and grace. He also impresses with his dance moves and expressions in the songs. Ayesha Takia, who plays Shagun, is the surprise package of the movie. She delivers a confident and natural performance as the girl who hides her vulnerability behind her attitude. She also shares a good chemistry with Shahid Kapoor. Tulip Joshi, who plays Sarah, is decent in her role, but does not have much scope to shine. Soha Ali Khan, who plays Neha, makes a decent debut, but her character is not very likable or convincing.
 
Dil Maange More is a movie that has some flaws and drawbacks. The story is predictable and cliched, and does not offer anything new or fresh. The screenplay is weak and inconsistent, and does not justify the actions and motivations of the characters. The dialogues are average and sometimes cheesy. The direction is mediocre and lacks finesse. The editing is choppy and abrupt, and the movie seems to drag at places. The climax is illogical and absurd, and leaves the viewer unsatisfied.
 
Dil Maange More is a movie that tries to be a fun and breezy romantic comedy, but falls short of its potential. It has some moments of humor and romance, but they are not enough to sustain the interest of the viewer. It is a movie that can be watched once for its songs and performances, but does not leave a lasting impression.
