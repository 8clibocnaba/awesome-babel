## Smart Code Completion and Navigation
 
AppCode 2018.2.5 provides smart code completion and navigation for both Swift and Objective-C.

AppCode also supports code generation and templates, so you can quickly create classes, methods, properties, tests, and more.
 
## Powerful Refactorings and Intentions
 
AppCode 2018.2.5 offers a wide range of refactorings and intentions for both Swift and Objective-C. You can rename variables, methods, classes, and files; extract variables, parameters, methods, and closures; inline variables and methods; move and copy members; change signatures; and much more. AppCode also suggests quick-fixes and intentions to improve your code quality and style.
 
## Advanced Code Analysis and Formatting
 
AppCode 2018.2.5 analyzes your code on the fly and highlights errors, warnings, and code smells. You can also run inspections on the whole project or on selected files and folders to detect potential problems and optimize your code. AppCode also supports code formatting and reformatting, so you can easily adjust your code style to match your preferences or standards.
