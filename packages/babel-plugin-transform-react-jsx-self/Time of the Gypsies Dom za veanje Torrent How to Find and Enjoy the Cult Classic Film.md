Time of the Gypsies is not only a realistic portrayal of the harsh and colorful life of the Romani people, but also a poetic and symbolic exploration of their culture and identity. The film uses elements of magic realism, such as Perhan's telekinesis and his grandmother's healing powers, to express the spiritual and mystical aspects of the Romani worldview. The film also contrasts the traditional values of family, loyalty and honor with the modern influences of greed, violence and corruption.
 
The film is directed by Emir Kusturica, one of the most acclaimed and controversial filmmakers from the former Yugoslavia. Kusturica is known for his distinctive style of filmmaking, which combines epic storytelling, surreal imagery, dark humor and Balkan music. He has won two Palme d'Or awards at the Cannes Film Festival, for When Father Was Away on Business (1985) and Underground (1995). He has also been criticized for his political views and his representation of the Yugoslav wars.
 
Time of the Gypsies is widely regarded as one of Kusturica's best films and a masterpiece of cinema. It has influenced many other filmmakers, such as Tony Gatlif, who made a trilogy of films about the Romani people: Latcho Drom (1993), Gadjo Dilo (1997) and Vengo (2000). It has also inspired many musicians, such as Goran BregoviÄ, who composed the film's soundtrack and became a popular performer of Balkan music around the world.
