If you are looking for a standard that specifies the general tolerances for welded constructions, you might have come across ISO 13920 BF. This is one of the four classes of tolerances defined by ISO 13920, which covers the dimensions for lengths and angles, as well as the shape and position of welded structures[^1^].

But what does BF mean and how does it differ from the other classes? And more importantly, how can you get a PDF copy of this standard for free? In this article, we will answer these questions and provide you with some useful resources to learn more about ISO 13920 BF.
 
## What is ISO 13920 BF?
 
ISO 13920 BF is the class of tolerances that applies to welded structures with high requirements on accuracy and appearance. It is suitable for structures that are subjected to dynamic loads or fatigue, or that have special functional or aesthetic demands. The BF class has the smallest range of tolerances among the four classes, which are AF, BF, CF and DF[^1^].
 
The tolerances for linear and angular dimensions in ISO 13920 BF are given in Table 1. The tolerances for shape and position are given in Table 2. These tables are based on the nominal size of the weldment, which is the sum of the nominal sizes of the individual components[^1^].

| Nominal size [mm] | Tolerance class | AF [mm] | BF [mm] | CF [mm] | DF [mm] |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| up to 100 | Linear dimensions | +/- 0.5 | +/- 0.5 | +/- 1 | +/- 2 |

| up to 200 | Linear dimensions | +/- 0.5 | +/- 0.5 | +/- 1.5 | +/- 3 |

| up to 400 | Linear dimensions | +/- 0.5 | +/- 0.5 | +/- 2 | +/- 4 |

| up to 1000 | Linear dimensions | +/- 1 | +/- 1 | +/- 3 | +/- 6 |

| up to 2000 | Linear dimensions | +/- 2 | +/- 2 | +/- 4.5 | +/- 9 |

| up to 4000 | Linear dimensions | +/- 3.5 | +/- 3.5 | +/- 6.5 | +/-13 |

| Angular dimensions (degrees) | +/-0.5

How to Get ISO 13920 BF PDF for Free?
<br>ISO 13920 BF is a standard that is widely used in the welding industry, especially for structures that require high precision and quality. However, getting a PDF copy of this standard can be challenging, as it is not freely available online. The official source of ISO standards is the ISO website, where you can purchase a PDF or hardcopy version of ISO 13920 BF for 58 Swiss francs (about 63 US dollars)[^1^]. However, this might be too expensive for some users who just need a quick reference or a one-time use.<br>
<br>Fortunately, there are some alternative ways to get ISO 13920 BF PDF for free, or at least for a lower cost. Here are some of them:<br>
<ul>
<li>Use an academic or library account. If you are a student, researcher, or faculty member of an academic institution, you might have access to ISO standards through your library or online database. For example, some universities subscribe to the SAI Global database, which provides access to thousands of standards, including ISO 13920 BF[^2^]. You can check with your library or IT department if they have such a subscription and how to access it.</li>
<li>Use a free trial or membership. Some online platforms that sell ISO standards also offer free trials or memberships that allow you to download a limited number of standards for free or for a reduced price. For example, Techstreet offers a 14-day free trial that lets you download up to 10 standards[^3^]. You can sign up for a free trial and download ISO 13920 BF within the trial period. However, be aware that you might need to provide your credit card information and cancel your subscription before the trial ends to avoid being charged.</li>
<li>Use a file-sharing website. Another option is to use a file-sharing website that hosts PDF copies of ISO standards uploaded by other users. For example, Academia.edu has a PDF file of ISO 13920 BF that you can download for free. However, be careful when using this method, as the quality and legality of the files might vary. You should always check the file for viruses and malware before opening it, and respect the intellectual property rights of the original authors.</li>
</ul>
<br>These are some of the ways to get ISO 13920 BF PDF for free or for a lower cost. However, keep in mind that these methods are not endorsed by ISO or any other official organization, and they might not always work or be available. The best way to ensure that you get a reliable and updated version of ISO 13920 BF is to purchase it from the ISO website or an authorized distributor.<br>
