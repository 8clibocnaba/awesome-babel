# How to Download Bhava Chalit Kundali Software for Free
  
If you are interested in Vedic astrology and want to generate your own kundali or birth chart, you might be looking for a reliable and accurate bhava chalit kundali software. A bhava chalit kundali is a chart that shows the exact position of the planets in the houses of the zodiac signs, based on the time and place of birth. Unlike the rashi chart, which uses a fixed division of 30 degrees for each sign, the bhava chalit chart uses a variable division based on the rising degree at the time of birth. This makes the bhava chalit chart more precise and realistic, as it reflects the actual movement of the planets in the sky.

Some may have outdated data, inaccurate calculations, or hidden charges.
