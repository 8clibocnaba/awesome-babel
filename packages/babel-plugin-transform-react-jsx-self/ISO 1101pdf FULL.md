# What is ISO 1101.pdf and why is it important for geometrical product specifications?
 
ISO 1101.pdf is a document that contains the international standard for geometrical product specifications (GPS) and geometrical tolerancing. It defines the symbol language for specifying the shape, size, orientation, location and run-out of features on workpieces, and the rules for interpreting these specifications. It also provides the foundation for other GPS standards that deal with more specific aspects of geometrical tolerancing, such as datums, modifiers, verification and measurement.
 
ISO 1101.pdf is important for geometrical product specifications because it ensures a clear and consistent communication of design intent and quality requirements between different parties involved in the product lifecycle, such as designers, manufacturers, inspectors and customers. It also helps to reduce ambiguity, errors and disputes that may arise from different interpretations of geometrical specifications. By following the principles and rules of ISO 1101.pdf, one can achieve a better control of product geometry and functionality, as well as a higher efficiency and quality of production and inspection processes.

ISO 1101.pdf was first published in 1983 and has been revised several times since then to reflect the latest developments and best practices in geometrical tolerancing. The current version is ISO 1101:2017, which was published in February 2017[^2^]. It replaces the previous version ISO 1101:2012 and introduces some changes and improvements, such as:
 
- A new clause on basic concepts that explains the fundamental principles of geometrical tolerancing
- A new clause on symbols that defines the graphical symbols for geometrical specifications and their meanings
- A new clause on toleranced features that clarifies how to identify and group features that are subject to geometrical tolerancing
- A new clause on tolerance zones that describes how to define and locate tolerance zones for different types of geometrical specifications
- A new annex on visible annotation that illustrates how to fully indicate a geometrical specification with visible annotation (including e.g. TEDs)
- A new annex on examples of geometrical specifications that provides examples of how to apply geometrical tolerancing to various types of features and situations

1. Identify the features that are relevant for the product function and quality, and group them into toleranced features according to their geometrical characteristics and relationships
2. Select the appropriate symbols for geometrical tolerancing from the symbol table in ISO 1101.pdf, and place them on the drawing or model in a clear and unambiguous way
3. Define the tolerance zones for each geometrical specification, and specify their size, shape, orientation and location with respect to datums or other reference features
4. Apply any modifiers or annotations that are necessary to refine or explain the geometrical specification, such as material condition, maximum material requirement, datum reference frame, etc.
5. Verify that the geometrical specification is complete, consistent and compliant with the rules of ISO 1101.pdf and other GPS standards

An example of how to apply ISO 1101.pdf for a simple geometrical specification is shown below:
 ![Example of geometrical specification](https://i.imgur.com/9f0LJjv.png) 
In this example, the feature A is a cylindrical hole that is subject to a position tolerance of 0.2 mm with respect to datums B and C. The symbol for position tolerance is placed above the dimension of the hole diameter, and the datums are indicated by letters in square frames. The tolerance zone is a cylinder of 0.2 mm diameter that is coaxial with datum axis B and perpendicular to datum plane C. The modifier M indicates that the position tolerance applies at maximum material condition, which means that the hole can be larger but not smaller than its nominal size.
